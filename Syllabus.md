# BA 510 Databases for Business Analytics
*Spring 2019*
## Course Description
This course introduces databases and data management in four parts:
1. __An introduction to database terminology__, with hands-on instructions in Structured Query Language (SQL) SELECT queries needed to extract data from a relational database.
2. __SQL Data Definition and Manipulation queries__, accompanied by the basics of data modeling and normalization needed to ensure data integrity. (For the benefit those who have had BA 505 Python for Analytics, supplemental instruction will be given to the use of SQL data sources in Python/Pandas. It is entirely optional, without any bearing on class grades.)
3. __A review of business applications__, with links to business intelligence and data warehousing.  
4. __A comprehensive data engineering project__ that gives each student the opportunity to integrate and apply their new knowledge and skills.  

(Prerequisite: BA 500; Credit hours: 3)

## Learning Objectives

* To introduce and reinforce fundamentals of data modeling and relational database systems
* To provide students with hands-on knowledge of Structured Query Language
* To provide students with an understanding of design skills needed to create databases from original source data
* To enable each student to apply course concepts through a database-based business analytics project


## Instructor
Christopher L. Huntley  
Dolan School of Business, Room 1122  
Email: chuntley@fairfield.edu  

## Office Hours
  * Tuesdays 5:00-6:15pm
  * Mondays and Thursdays 12:15-1:00pm  
  * Other times are by appointment only. However, email works well, especially when the instructor is otherwise unavailable.

## Resources
* **Textbook:** Kroenke and Auer, Database Processing: Fundamentals, Design, Implementation, 14-th Edition, Pearson, 2016. (The 15-th edition is also available but the notes are based on the 14-th edition.)
* **Online Tutorials:** [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)'s online SQL courses plus a few bespoke case projects designed to accompany the lectures.
* **Software:** JupyterLab (editor & runtime environment), MySQL (database server), SQLite (file-based RDB), Lucidchart (diagramming tool), GitHub (source control).
* **Reference Docs:** The official [MySQL Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en) covers the MySQL server and coding. SQLite is covered [here](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html). When in doubt, [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM).
* **Hardware:** Each student is expected to bring a recent-vintage laptop to class. If you intend to do the DataCamp tutorials in class, then please use earbuds so as not to disturb your classmates.
* **Websites:**  
    * Class documents (including this syllabus) are in [Dr. Huntley's ba510-docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/ba510-docs).
    * Coding assignments are posted and submitted though [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com).

## Student Expectations
This is a graduate class intended for serious professionals:
* Expect to spend at least 12 hours per week attending class and completing your assignments (and be pleasantly surprised if you finish early).
* Do your own work. There is no professional benefit to pretending that somebody else's work is your own. We will follow the university's academic honesty policy to the letter.
* Be a good teammate and class citizen. Free-riding and other unprofessional behavior will result in immediate consequences, which may include failing the course.
* This is a SQL-based introduction to relational databases. The goal is language fluency. That means writing lots of SQL code by hand, eventually without referring to the manual.  

*If you cannot abide by these policies then please take another course.*

## Assignments and Course Grade
### Quizzes (50% of Course Grade)
There will be five quizzes, with the lowest grade dropped from your quiz average. They will be given on the days shown in the attached schedule of classes. Quizzes are closed book and closed notes. They are designed to last about 25 minutes, though students will be permitted to work on them up to 40 minutes. The remainder of the class time will be devoted to new material. Please notify the instructor if you require extra time or support services.  
### Final Project (40% of Course Grade)
The final project is meant to a demonstration that the course objectives have been met. Teams will work in teams of 2-3 to complete a project of intermediate complexity and scope. Project details and requirements will be distributed on February 26.
### Professionalism (10% of Course Grade)
Given the large class enrollment and the technical nature of the subject, it is critical that everyone take a professional approach to learning the material. Students are expected to come to class prepared and then participate in all activities to the best of their abilities. Cheating, free-riding, and other unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.  
### Grading Scale
All scores will be scaled to a GPA scale *before* they are included in your course grade. The scaling formula will be given in the first class period.

## Schedule
* **Dates and assignments are subject to change**, often with less than one week's notice. Consult the online class agendas for the most up-to-date information.
* **Classwork** is to be completed before leaving class.
* **Homework** is to be completed before the next class.
* Saturday class dates are shown **in bold**.
* **K/A *X*** refers to Kroenke & Auer Chapter X
