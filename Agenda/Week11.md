        * Scope: What kinds of questions should the DW answer? Be very specific, as this will determine your facts and dimensions.
        * Design: Draw an ERD for each fact table in your DW; dimensions can appear on multiple ERDs.
        * Implementation: Create the dimension tables first, then the fact tables, which should have lots of FKs to the dimension tables. You can add new dimension tables if needed.  
4. Classwork and Homework
    * Continue to collaborate on class projects
