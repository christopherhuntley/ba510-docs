         - One student creates the team; the others join
         - A forked copy of the repository will appear in the class GitHub organization
         - Each student has "contributor" rights to the repository
         - You may want to bookmark the GitHub repository so you can find it again
    - ONE STUDENT PER TEAM DOES THIS:
         - Clone the forked copy to your workspace (BA Lab)
         - Read the instructions.md file
         - Create all needed notebook files; this is important as it will also create some hidden files that can't be created twice.
         - Commit and push the changes so the rest of the team can see them
    - THE REST OF THE TEAM DOES THIS:
         - Once the first student has done the initial setup, the others clone it to their workspaces
