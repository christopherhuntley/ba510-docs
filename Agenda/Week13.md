## Week 13 April 21/22, 2020

1. Project Workshop 
    * Heed last week's warning about INSERT queries
    * `CourseDataWarehouse.db` (Step 5)
        * Scope: What kinds of questions should the DW answer? Be very specific, as this will determine your facts and dimensions.
        * Design: Draw an ERD for each fact table in your DW; dimensions can appear on multiple ERDs.
        * Implementation: Create the dimension tables first, then the fact tables, which should have lots of FKs to the dimension tables. You can add new dimension tables if needed. 
    * Testing (Step 6)
        * Write SQL queries to make sure your design and data are right
    * Demo (Step 7)
        * Write queries to demonstrate that you can answer the kinds of questions you targeted in step 5.
    * Cleanup and Final Report (Step 8) 
        * Your notebooks should be readable. Clean up your code, add markdown explaining what you are doing and add structure to your document. It should read like a report, because that's what it is!
        * Add a `Readme.md` markdwon file, that acts as a table of contents for your project. It's what GitHub shows by default when you open a folder. You are going to walk us through your project next week using this `Readme.md` file. 
3. Classwork and Homework
    * Continue to collaborate on class projects
